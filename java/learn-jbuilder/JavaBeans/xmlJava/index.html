<p>We decided to cut the XML chapter. I know this subject fairly well, but the
  book was just getting too long. This program was a rough draft of one of the
  programs intended for use in that chapter.</p>

<P>This programs relies on Xerxes.jar, which ships with most versions of 
JBuilder.  It is open source, so you can download it if you want.  <A 
HREF="http://xml.apache.org/">http://xml.apache.org/</A> </P> 


<p>I have commented out the assertions, so this program will compile from the
  command line if you have Java 1.3.1. </p>

<p>This program cannot be run as an applet under normal security settings
because it accesses the harddrive.</p>
