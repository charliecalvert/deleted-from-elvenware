<p>This program is discussed in Chapter 25, the <a href="../../index.html/projects">Complex
  Projects</a> chapter.</p>
<p>This is a particular interesting example because of what is happening with
  the classpath. As explained at length in the book, the ElfTimer.java file which
  is key to this project is stored in the src directory beneath this directory.
  In particular, it is outside the directory that hosts this project. One of the
  main points of the Complex Projects chapter is to explain how to handle this
  kind of situation inside of JBuilder. Here is code for handling this problem
  in an Ant script:</p>
<pre>		&lt;javac destdir=&quot;${build}&quot;&gt;<br>			&lt;src path=&quot;${src}&quot;/&gt;<br>			&lt;src path=&quot;$../src&quot;/&gt;<br>		&lt;/javac&gt;</pre>
<p>Notice that the second src element points at the directory that holds the timeit.ElfTimer.java
  component. </p>
<p>If you are having trouble running this program,<a href="../../index.html">
  index.html </a> provides useful information about setting up the code that comes
  with this book.</p>
