<h3>Math Operators and Floating Point Numbers</h3>
<p class=MsoNormal>In this section of the chapter you will learn how to use operators
  with floating point numbers. To do this, I will create another example application.
  This application will let you work with floating point numbers, and it will
  allow you to learn a good deal more about the JList class.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>The basic concept of this application, which is called floatops,
  is that the user can display a few rows of numbers in a JList on the left, move
  a certain percentage of those numbers to the JList on the right, and then perform
  operations on those numbers in the list on the right. For instance, he can add
  them all up, or multiply them together. An example of adding the numbers in
  the right hand list together is shown in Figure 5.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Figure 5: Adding a list of numbers.</b>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>I
  could have foregone the left-hand JList altogether and had the user type things
  directly into the right-hand JList. But at this stage we are just having a bit
  of instructive fun, and are not yet to the stage where we want to struggle with
  the act of creating a user-friendly program that might do something useful in
  the real world.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Here is how we can add a series of randomly chosen floating
  points numbers to a JList:</p>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>void fillListMenuItem_actionPerformed(ActionEvent e)</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>{</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>{</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>Double D = new Double(Math.random() * 100.0);</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>listModel.addElement(D);</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>}</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>}</pre>
<p class=MsoNormal>This code might seem a bit peculiar at first. In particular,
  you might expect that it should look like this:</p>
<pre><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>void fillListMenuItem_actionPerformed(ActionEvent e)</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>{</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>{</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>String S = Double.toString(Math.random() * 100.0);</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>listModel.addElement(S);</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>}</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>}</pre>
<p class=MsoNormal>The first example of the <b>fillListMenuItem</b> handler works
  with <b>doubles</b>, and the second works with <b>strings</b>. Both examples
  compile and perform as expected in Java. I tend to think of the elements in
  a list box as strings. But as you can see, in this case we are able to add either
  <b>Doubles</b> or <b>Strings</b> to the list of elements displayed in the JList.
  The doubles themselves are actually stored in the list, but the double toString
  method is used to display a value in the list to the user in the JList.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>You have to be careful here, and note that the code adds objects
  of type <b>Double</b> to the <b>DefaultListModel</b>, and not variables of type
  <b>double</b>. The point here is that the <b>addElement</b> method of the <b>DefaultListModel</b>
  object takes variables of type <b>Object</b>. All the Java classes descend from
  class <b>Object</b>. Furthermore, all the Java classes implement a method called
  <b>toString</b>. This means that no matter what kind of class you put in the
  <b>DefaultListModel</b>, it should, at least in theory, be able to display itself
  in the <b>JList</b> class.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>I like this kind of technology a lot, but it requires that
  developers are able to think at a fairly high level of abstraction. Objects
  are inherently abstract entities, and it takes awhile to get used to thinking
  about them in the right spirit.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Let us now revisit the code in the <b>fillListMenuItem</b>
  response method, and see how the list of doubles is made visible to the user.
  The code begins by creating a double with a random value between 0 and 100:</p>
<pre>Double D = new Double(Math.random() * 100.0);</pre>
<p class=MsoNormal>The <b>Math.random</b> method returns a value between 0.0 and
  1.0. If you multiply the random value by 100, then you end up with a number
  between 0.0 and 100.0.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Once you have a new random value to work with, you need to
  convert it into an object of type <b>Double</b>, or, perhaps more accurately,
  you need to wrap it up inside an object of type <b>Double</b>. </p>
<p class=note>NOTE: As I said earlier, object oriented code is tricky to think
  about at times. An object of type <b>Double</b> is meant to fairly seamlessly
  wrap the type <b>double</b>. As a result, you should be able to think of a <b>Double</b>
  as a <b>double</b>, and treat it pretty much the same way in your code. C++,
  in fact, makes it possible for you to create a class <b>Double</b> such that
  there are almost no distinctions between a variable of type <b>double</b> and
  an object of type <b>Double</b>. This is in large part due to the presence in
  C++ of operator overloading, which is an extraordinarily powerful tool. In the
  right hands, operator overloading can produce miracles. Unfortunately, in the
  wrong hands, operator overloading creates chaos. The odds that any one programmer
  will make good use of operator overloading were a bit low in the opinion of
  the creators of Java, so they decided to leave operator overloading out of the
  language. The end result is that you have to think more consciously of the object
  <b>Double</b> as an object, and can't merely think of it as a fancy variable
  of type double that knows how to do all kinds of neat tricks. In particular,
  you have to explicitly call its toString, valueOf, toInt, toShort, and so on,
  methods. Explicit calls to these methods would not usually be necessary in a
  language that supports operator overloading. However, the Java syntax is very
  clean, intuitive, and unlikely to produce hard to resolve bugs. Hurray for Java.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>The next part of your job is to add the random number that
  you created to the JList:</p>
<pre>listModel.addElement(D);</pre>
<p class=MsoNormal>By now, you should be able to fully appreciate the implications
  of being able to add objects of type double to this list rather than having
  to work with objects of type string. The end result is shown in Figure 6.</p>
<p class=figure>Figure 6: A list of doubles displayed in a JList component. You
  are looking at a list of strings, but internally, the JList is really maintaining
  a list of Doubles.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Here is the whole loop to study once again:</p>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>{</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>String S = Double.toString(Math.random() * 100.0);</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>listModel.addElement(S);</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>}</pre>
<p class=MsoNormal>The two lines of code inside the block statement that follows
  the first line of code gets called ten times, one for each count of the variable
  i between and including the value 0, and up to but excluding the value 10.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Moving an Item from One JList to Another</h3>
<p class=MsoNormal>As you recall, this example program works with two JLists.
  The list on the left presents the user with a randomly selected group of numbers.
  By clicking on any one of these numbers the user can move that number from the
  left hand list to the right hand list. Once it is in the right hand list, the
  user can perform operations on the numbers, such as addition, or multiplication.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Here is code that will allow you to move one of the items on
  the left hand JList over to the JList on the right.</p>
<pre>/** </pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>* Get the selected item and move it from the list on the </pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>* left to the list on the right, deleting it from the list </pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>* on the left. </pre>
<pre>*/</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>void jList1_mouseClicked(MouseEvent e)</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>{</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Double D = (Double)listModel.get(jList1.getSelectedIndex());</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>listModel.remove(jList1.getSelectedIndex());</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>mathList.addElement(D);</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>}</pre>
<p class=MsoNormal>This method will be called when the user clicks on a particular
  number in the left hand list box. The goal is to delete that number from the
  <b>JList</b> on the left, and move it to the <b>JList</b> on the right. The
  first step in this process is to find the number the user selected:</p>
<pre><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></pre>
<pre>Double D = (Double)listModel.get(jList1.getSelectedIndex());</pre>
<p class=MsoNormal>A call <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>to jList1.getSelectedIndex</b>
  will retrieve the index of the item that the user has selected from the left-hand
  list. The first element in the list is item 0, the second item 1, and so on.
  If the user has selected the third item in the list, then <b>getSelectedIndex</b>
  will return the integer value 2.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>A call to <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>listModel.get(2)</b>
  would retrieve the third item in the <b>DefaultListModel</b> object referenced
  by the identifier <b>listModel</b>. A <b>DefaultListModel</b> works with items
  of type Object. Object is the root object from which all Java objects descend.
  So in this case, I must typecast the value returned by a call to the get method.
  In particular the value is typecast as a Double, which is in fact that type
  of object we have stored in this list. (Forgive me if I am using a bit of repetition
  to drive home points that I feel deserve special emphasis.)</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>The end result of all these peregrinations is a return of the
  value the user selected with the mouse. The next step is to remove it from the
  current list, and add it to the list on the right:</p>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>listModel.remove(jList1.getSelectedIndex());</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>mathList.addElement(D);</pre>
<p class=MsoNormal>The first line of code here calls the <b>remove</b> method
  of the <b>DefaultListModel</b> object. As you can see, I pass in the index of
  the item I want to remove. I get the index by calling jList1.getSelectedIndex.
  If I had desired to do so, I could have saved the value from my previous call
  to this method rather than calling it twice. Optimizations of that type are
  something I would explore if I found the application was performing poorly,
  and I thought minor changes to the code would rectify the problem. In this case
  I felt that the program was performing fine, and I felt that a change of this
  type to the code was very unlikely to significantly alter its performance. In
  short, I was being lazy.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Once I had deleted the item from the list on the left, I added
  it to the list on the right by calling the <b>addElement</b> method of the <b>DefaultListModel</b>
  object. At that stage, I was done with this rather simple operation.</p>
<h2>Adding Up a List of Numbers</h2>
<p class=MsoNormal>It is now time to see how to add up or multiply all the numbers
  in the list on the right. The mechanisms for doing each of these procedures
  are nearly identical. In particular, both operations involve iterating over
  all the items in the second list box, then either adding or multiplying the
  list of items together.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Because the two operations are so nearly identical, I have
  decided to throw in some variety by presenting two different ways to iterate
  over the items in the second <b>JList</b>. In the first technique, the one I
  use when adding the numbers, I show a standard way to iterate over items in
  a list. In the second example, the one involving multiplication, I show a special
  kind of iterator that is specific to Java.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Here is code for iterating through all the numbers in the <b>JList</b>
  on the right and displaying the result:</p>
<pre><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>void addMenuItem_actionPerformed(ActionEvent e)</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>{</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>double total = 0;</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Double num;</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>int Count = mathList.getSize();</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>for (int i = 0; i &lt; Count; i++)</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>{</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>num = (Double)mathList.get(i);</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>total = total + num.doubleValue();</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>}</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>mathList.addElement(&quot;-----------&quot;);</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>mathList.addElement(Double.toString(total));</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>}</pre>
<p class=MsoNormal>The code begins by calling the <b>getSize</b> method of the
  <b>DefaulListModel</b> object to get the number of objects in the list. I then
  perform a <b>for</b> loop to iterate over each item in the list. The <b>for</b>
  statement shown here executes <b>Count</b> number of times, with the variable
  <b>i</b> incrementing from <b>0</b> to <b>Count-1</b> during the life of the
  <b>for</b> loop.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>I call the <b>get</b> method of the <b>DefaultListModel</b>
  to retrieve the first element in the list. I then add that number to a variable
  called <b>total</b> that was initially set to zero. If the first item in the
  list was 1.72, then after the first iteration of the <b>for</b> loop, the value
  of <b>total</b> gets set to 1.72. Suppose the second time through the loop the
  value of the <b>double</b> retrieved from the list happened to be 48.28. If
  that were the case, then after the second time through the loop, <b>total</b>
  would be equal to 50.0. The process would be repeated each time the loop executed
  until the program ran out of numbers to add together.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Once the program was out of numbers to add, it would insert
  a line of hyphens in the list box, and then print out an answer by calling the
  <b>Double.toString</b> method on the current value of the <b>total </b>variable.
  (Remember that you can call the <b>toString</b> method of the Double object
  without creating an instance of it because <b>toString</b> is declared as a
  static method.)</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>You might suppose that by this time I have completely forgotten
  the main topic of this chapter, which is operators. Fortunately, that matter
  has not entirely slipped my mind, though we certainly have drifted far from
  the topic at times! At any rate, the main reason you are looking at this code
  is simply to see that the plus operator works exactly the same way with floating
  point numbers as it does with integers.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Multiplying a list of Numbers Together</h2>
<p class=MsoNormal>This code will multiply all the numbers in the second list
  box together, rather than adding them together:</p>
<pre><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>void multiplyMenuItem_actionPerformed(ActionEvent e)</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>{</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>double total = 1;</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Double num;</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Enumeration mathEnum = mathList.elements();</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>while (mathEnum.hasMoreElements())</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>{</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>num = (Double)mathEnum.nextElement();</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>total = total * num.doubleValue();</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>}</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>mathList.addElement(&quot;-----------&quot;);</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>mathList.addElement(Double.toString(total));</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>}</pre>
<pre>}</pre>
<p class=MsoNormal>This code is very like the code used to add numbers. The main
  difference, besides the usage of the multiplication operator instead of the
  addition operator, is the use of an <b>Enumeration</b>.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>It happens that the <b>DefaultListModel</b> object is really
  just a fairly thin wrapper around another important Java object called a <b>Vector</b>.
  In fact, as you have been learning how to use the <b>DefaultListModel</b>, you
  have really been learning the basic principles that underlie the Java <b>Vector</b>
  class.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>A vector, as you no doubt know, is just a list, or an array,
  of items. In our case, we have been working with a vector of <b>Objects</b>,
  and in particular, a vector of <b>Double</b> objects. In the addition example,
  we saw how to iterate over the members of that vector, by retrieving each of
  the <b>Double</b> objects in our list one at a time.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>It turns out that the <b>Vector</b> object, and hence the <b>DefaultListModel</b>,
  has a special means for allowing you to iterate over its members. The code for
  performing that operation looks like this:</p>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>Enumeration mathEnum = mathList.elements();</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>while (mathEnum.hasMoreElements())</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>{</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>mathEnum.nextElement();</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>....</pre>
<pre><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>}</pre>
<p class=MsoNormal>The first line show here calls the elements method of the <b>Vector</b>
  or <b>DefaultListModel</b> class in order to retrieve an object called an <b>Enumeration</b>.
  To use the <b>Enumeration</b> object, you must be sure that you first import
  the java.util.* classes at the top of your java file:</p>
<pre><o:p></o:p></pre>
<pre>package floatops;</pre>
<pre>import java.awt.*;</pre>
<pre>import java.awt.event.*;</pre>
<pre>import javax.swing.*;</pre>
<pre>import java.util.*;</pre>
<p class=MsoNormal>The <b>Enumeration</b> object has two methods, one called <b>hasMoreElements</b>
  and the other called <b>nextElement</b>. By using these two methods you can
  iterate over all the elements in a <b>Vector</b>.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>In particular, you write code that says that you should keep
  calling the <b>nextElement</b> method to retrieve the next element from the
  list so long as the <b>hasMoreElements</b> method returns true. Remember that
  a <b>while</b> loop lets you perform a particular operation over and over again,
  so long as a particular expression evaluates to true.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>I won't spend any more time discussing the rest of the code
  for the multiplication method, since it is so nearly identical to the code for
  the addition method. If necessary, spend some time studying it until it begins
  to make sense to you.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>I will leave examples of working with the /, - and % operators
  in a context similar to the ones shown here as an exercise for the reader.&nbsp;</p>
