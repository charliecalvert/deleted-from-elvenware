<p> <strong>Description: </strong>An example of how to use the Google APIs to 
  run queries again Google from your java programs. Actually, its a web service, 
  so you could do it from anywhere.</p>
<p>All the code you need is present and ready to use. At run time, however, you 
  will be prompted for your google license key. You need to sign on to google's 
  site to get a key./ At the time of this writing the place to go was:<br>
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/apis/">http://www.google.com/apis/</a><br>
</p>
<p>The sign in process is free, and they will immediately mail you your key. </p>
<p>If you have forgotten your key, sign in again and they will resend your key.</p>
<p>This progarm is not mentioned in the book. The program works fine, and the 
  topic is interesting, but the book was too long already, and the Google API 
  is not really closely related to JBuilder itself.</p>
