</head>
<body>
<p>This project is designed to show you how to use the simplest possible application 
  in a JBuilder project. If you are a student in a Java 101 course, then you would 
  build applications of this type. Members of an IS team that wanted to build 
  command line utilities might also create applications of this type.</p>
<p>The project uses no packages.</p>
<p>Here is the source for the entire project:</p>
<pre>public class SimpleClass
{

	public static void main(String arg[])
	{
	  System.out.println("Hi, ho the wind and the rain");
	}
}</pre>
