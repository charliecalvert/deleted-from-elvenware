<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<hr>
<p>This program is discussed in Chapter 39, on database setup, and in chapter 
  41, on database basics. It's purpose is to convert data from InterBase or MySQL 
  format to simple text based files. The files can be either filled with SQL statements, 
  or they can be filled with commad delimited data. The data is written automatically 
  to a subdirectory of your home directory called <b>elvenware</b>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>c:\documents and settings\user name\elvenware</li>
  <li>\home\user name\elvenware</li>
</ul>
<p>By pressing the <b>Text Convert </b>button you ask the program to convert data 
  to comma delimited format using the Borland database tools. There is a schema 
  file associated with the text file that describes the fields and their names. 
  These files can be read back in and converted into normal database tables. See 
  the ConvertToSQL.java file in the <b>com.elvenware.database</b> package. The 
  program is interesting because it reads the metadata from a table.</p>
<p>If you have trouble running this program, <a href=
"../../index.html">index.html</a> contains useful information about setting up 
  the code that comes with this book. Setting up databases is described at lengh 
  in the first few chapters of the database section of the book.</p>

<p>This program relies on an InterBase database called
music2.gdb. It ships on the CD that comes with this book in the
/Database/Data directory. You should place this file in a
directory called data which is beneath the home directory on your
system. For windows, the home directory is usually in
c:\Documents and Directories\UserName. On Linux, it is in the
/home/UserName. For instance, the file should be placed in:</p>

<pre>
/home/ccalvert/data/music2.gdb
</pre>
