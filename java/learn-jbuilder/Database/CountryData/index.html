<p> <strong>Description: </strong>This program converts data downloaded from the 
  US Census Bureau into SQL files that can be imported directly into a database. 
  The tables will contain data about the population of most (all?) of the countries 
  in the world over a time span. How many people were there in past years, how 
  many are there today, and how many will there be in future years.</p>
<p>This should probably be converted into a command line utility. As it is now, 
  just make the jar file, CountryData.jar from the IDE, then copy it into the 
  data directory and run it: java -jar CountryData.jar. When the program runs, 
  for now, it will pop up an interface, press the browse button, and the program 
  will convert the txt data files into sql files which can be inserted into a 
  database.</p>

<p>The main frame hosts two simple beans called ControlPanel and DisplayData.</p>

<p>This program is discussed in Chapter 39, on database setup.</p>
