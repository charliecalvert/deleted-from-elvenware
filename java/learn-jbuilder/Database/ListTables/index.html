<p> <strong>Description: </strong>Shows a lookup between the Album table and the 
  Types, Loudness and Medium Tables.</p>
<p>The goal of this technology is to perform a link a column in one table with
  a dataset from another table. Think of the classic example of rating a movie
  on a scale of 1 to 5 stars. One star means bad, two starts ok, three good, four
  stars great, five stars and its an a classic. In your main table you store the
  values one to five. But in you want to show to the user the words, bad, oky,
  good, great, and classic. These later values are stored in a second table:</p>

<pre>
  Code StrValue
  1    bad
  2    ok
  3    good
  4    great
  5    classic
</pre>

  <p>The second table will be called a lookup list, or pick list. A pick list is a
  synonym for a lookup list. </p>

  <p> The parameters here are tricky. The first is the dataset containing the
  lookup values. The second is the column in the lookup list that the link
  is make on. For instance, in the 1 to 5 list above, that would be the
  CODE column. The next two columns are from the master list. The fifth
  colunmn is the name of the column in the master list to display on.</p>
<pre>
	columnTypes.setPickList(
		new com.borland.dx.dataset.PickListDescriptor(
		queryDataSetTypes,			// The dataset containing the lookup values.
		new String[] {"CODE"},		// The link column in the pick list.
		new String[] {"TYPES"},		// The master column to display in.
		new String[] {"TYPES"},		// The master column to associate on
		"TYPES",					// The column from the pick list to display
		true));

</pre>

<p>This program is discussed in Chapter 41, on database basics, in Chapter 43, 
  on database strategies, and in Chapter 45 on SQL queries.</p>
