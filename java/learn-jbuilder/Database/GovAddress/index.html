<p> <strong>Description: Get Contact info for House and Senate</strong></p>
<p>This program processes a list containing the names of the address of the members 
  of the house of representatives.</p>
<p>The list can be obtained either from the web, or from disk. The list on the 
  web is maintained by the House of Representatives itself, and should be up to 
  date. The danger, of course, is that the list will be moved or its structure 
  changed. As a result, I also give you the option of parsing the list from disk, 
  downloaded in Aprill of 2002.</p>
<p>The program will also convert the list into a sql file that can be loaded into 
  most databases.</p>
<hr>
<p>This program is not discussed in the book.</p>
