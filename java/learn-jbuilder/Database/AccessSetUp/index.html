<p> <strong>Description: </strong><!-- #BeginEditable "Description" -->Don't run 
  this program unless you are sure you know what you are doing. It is designed 
  to move the jbbook data into an access databases. As such, it is a program that 
  readers of this book will probably not want to run, since the CD includes a 
  properly set up version of the jbbook data for Access users. I include it here 
  only for those who are interested in seeing how I moved the data. The program 
  proides some interesting examples of how to use use data modules and queryDataSets. 
  You should also see the MusicConvert program, which is tied in with this program 
  in that it creates the SQL files that this program uses. This program is something 
  of a work in progress. Not all the data from the MusicConvert program will run 
  in this program immediately. I had to tweak some of the tables. But the data 
  that ships with the CD should work for you. It does work for me. The order in 
  which tables are deleted, and the order in which data is inserted into the tables, 
  is important. The significance where has to do with foreign keys. I can't insert 
  data into a table that depends on another table unless the data it depends on 
  has already been inserted.<!-- #EndEditable --> </p>
