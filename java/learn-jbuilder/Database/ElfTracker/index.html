<p> <strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>To run this program, you are going to need to have <a href="../../index.html#ant">ant</a> installed
  on your system, and you will need to set up a library file that points at the
  ant.jar file. In this case, having Ant on your system is not about using Ant to help
  you compile the project. Rather the project itself depends on the Ant libraries.
  This program uses Ant.</p>
  <p>Ant ships with most editions of JBuilder 7 and higher. You can also get ant from www.apache.org, and then looking in the jakarta
  project. Choose Project | project properties and turn to the Paths | Required
  Libraries page. Setup, add, or edit a library called ant to point to the ant.jar
  file.</p>
<p>Besides the projects absolute reliance on ant.jar, this project also has
an ant node in its project panel. It is nice, but not necessary, to have
the open source project AntRunner set up with JBuilder, as explained in
the text.</p>

<p>You will install need to have mysql install, with an alias in it for a
database called jbbook: "jdbc:mysql://localhost/jbbook." You will also
have to have the mysql jdbc driver installed: org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver.</p>

<p>You can find mm.mysql at these locations:</p>

<p>http://mmmysql.sourceforge.net/</p>
<p>http://mmmysql.sourceforge.net/doc/mm.doc/book1.htm</p>

<hr>
<p>This program is discussed in Chapter 44, on data control, and in Chapter 45,
  on SQL queries.</p>
