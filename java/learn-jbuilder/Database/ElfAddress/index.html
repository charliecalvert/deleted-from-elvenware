<p>This <!-- #BeginEditable "programname" -->program<!-- #EndEditable --> is <!-- #BeginEditable "notfield" --><!-- #EndEditable -->discussed 
  in <!-- #BeginEditable "ChapterName" -->Chapter 43, on database strategies, 
  and in Chapter 45, on SQL queries.<!-- #EndEditable --></p>

<p>If you have trouble running this program, <a href="../../index.html">index.html</a>
    contains useful information about setting up the code that comes with
this book.</p>
 
<!-- #BeginEditable "FurtherDescription" --> 
<p>Creating the stored procedure. Enter as an SQL statement in IBConsoloe or the 
  JBuilder Pilot:</p>
<pre>CREATE GENERATOR ADDRESS_GEN;</pre>
<p>Commit your work:</p>
<pre>COMMIT;</pre>
<p>Here is how to create the stored procedure. Again, you would enter this as 
  an SQL statement in IBConcole or the JBuilder Pilot:</p>
<pre>SET TERM ^;
<p>CREATE PROCEDURE GETADDRESSGEN RETURNS (NUM INTEGER)
AS
BEGIN
  NUM = GEN_ID(ADDRESS_GEN, 1);
  SUSPEND;
END ^
COMMIT;</pre>
<p>Now that you the InterBase stored procedure set up, you need to call it from 
  JBuilder. Drop down a <b>ProcedureDataSet</b> from the DataExpress page. Select 
  its <b>procedure</b> property to bring up the <b>Procedure</b> dialog. Set the 
  <b>Database</b> field to the database you are using. (My code for allowing you 
  to switch between multiple databases can make this more complicated than it 
  would be normally. If you know you want to use InterBase, then just set up a 
  normal Database connection. Or, if you prefer, you can set the database up temporarily 
  then edit its generated code in the DataModules jbInit when you are done. Setting 
  up the database properly will only change the <b>setConnection</b> line of code. 
  You set the database up by choosing <b>database1</b> in the structure pane and 
  then selecting the <b>connection</b> property.) After you have the Database 
  set up, enter the following line of code and press the test button to make sure 
  it works:</p>
<pre>select * from GETADDRESSGEN</pre>
<p>This code can be generated automatically if you use the <b>Browse procedures</b> 
  button.</p>
<p><img src="Procedures.png" width="433" height="439"></p>
<p> If all is working correctly, you can go into edit mode and enter the following 
  method in your data module:</p>
<pre>    public int getNextCodeValue()<br>	{<br>		procedureDataSet1.executeQuery();<br>		int codeValue = procedureDataSet1.getInt(0);<br>		System.out.println(&quot;Next code value: &quot; + codeValue);<br>		return codeValue;<br>	}
</pre>
<p>Create an Adding event on the dataset you are using. In this case, the dataset 
  is called <b>address</b>. You would therefore go into design mode, select the 
  <b>address</b> component in the structure pane, then turn to the events page 
  in the inspector, and create the following method on the <b>Adding</b> event:</p>
<pre>
	void address_adding(DataSet dataSet, ReadWriteRow newRow) throws Exception<br>	{<br>		System.out.println(&quot;adding&quot;);<br>		newRow.setInt(0, getNextCodeValue());<br>		try<br>		{<br>			newRow.setTimestamp(&quot;LASTUPDATE&quot;, System.currentTimeMillis());<br>		}<br>		catch (DataSetException ex)<br>		{<br>			System.out.println(ex);<br>		}<br>	}<br></pre>
<p>And that is all you need to do. </p>
<p>For me, the hardest part of this process was realizing that I had to call <b>newRow.setTimestamp</b> 
  to set the LASTUPDATE field. I had a compulsion call <b>newRow.setDate</b>. 
  The LASTUPDATE field is a field I have included in the database so that I can 
  know when any particular field of the database was last modified. It should, 
  therefore be updated when a new row is added, and then each time that row is 
  edited.</p>
<p>This program also eliminates the need to press the Save to Server button. If 
  you press the checkmark save, or if you move off a record you have edited, then 
  on the Added or Updated events, I call address.saveChanges(), which makes permanent 
  any changes you have entered. This technique has pluses and minuses. It was 
  what I prefer in most cases, but there are reasons for not doing it. Among the 
  reasons for not doing it would be a desire to let the user easily roll back 
  a set of changes, and cutting down on a network traffic.</p>
