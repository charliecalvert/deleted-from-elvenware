<p> <strong>Description:</strong> Breakout is a Java version of the old console 
  game that is sometimes called Bricks.</p>
<p>It runs well on Windows if you have a good graphics card. It also runs quickly
  on Linux if you have a good graphics card, but it does not run at all smoothly
  on Linux.</p>
<p>Click once on the board to get the focus, then press the letter &quot;s&quot;
  on the keyboard to start the game. Use the mouse to move the paddle. Do not
  allow the mouse to move outside the main window.</p>
<p>When running from the command line, you will need the jar file called images.jar.
    The program loads it bitmaps from this file. I don't push it as hard as I should,
    but this shows a nice way to put the code in one place and images somewhere 
    else, so that you can use different images by just swapping in a new jar 
    file.</p>
