<p> <strong>Description:</strong>Overhead view of a building, 
  probably the white house. You can walk through the rooms, click on each object, 
  talk to the people there.</p>
<P>The goal is to find out what went wrong in the White House. Perhaps based on 
  the Iran Contra scandal.</P>
<P>This is a virtual world application. The world will be stored on application 
  servers running on the network. Users will be able to sign on to the server 
  and start wandering through worlds.</P>
<P>The main server will control the map on which the user moves. However, the 
  user will continually encounter objects on his travels, and each of these objects 
  will be handled by another server.</P>
<P>The servers should be object oriented, however. Each should inherit certain 
  capabilities. For instance, there would be an entity object, which would have 
  a location, a size and a few other traits such as hardness, tempature, etc. 
<P> 
<P>Other objects might include animate entities, knowledge entities such as books, 
  etc.</P>
<P>The user should always be able to look around them, getting information on 
  the current <A HREF="location.htm">location</A>
