<p><b>Description</b>: This program is meant to be run from the
command line. The root directory for the programs that come with
this CD, you will find a script called caleld runPrograms. That
is the proper way to run this program.</p>

<p>Program for launching the other programs that come with
Charlie Calvert\'s JBuilder Companion. This program depends on
Ant being set up correctly on your system.</p>

<p>I am having trouble launching the database programs with this
tool on Windows, but they work on Linux.</p>

<p>On Windows, you need to compile the programs first before you
run this program. The reason for this seems to be that JAVA_HOME
is being set to the jre, not the jdk.</p>

<p>You should be able to go to the command prompt, run the the
set-classpath script, and then type ant to build all the projects
in this directory tree. Then you can run this program with the
run programs script. This program is far from perfect, but it let
mef quickly and easily test most of the programs shipped with
this CD.</p>
