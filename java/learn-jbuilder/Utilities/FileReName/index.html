<p> <strong>Description:</strong> Rename long mp3 file names to shorter values
  and move the new file into the appropriate directory.</p>
<p>I subscribe to a service called emusic, found at www.emusic.com. When I down
  load mp3s from this source, and from others like it, I get very long filenames
  of this type:</p>
<p>Some_Artist-Some-Album-TrackNum-Song_Name.mp3</p>
<p>This program shortens these names by creating these directories:</p>
<p>Some_Artist</p>
<p>Some_Artist/Some_Album</p>
<p>And then renames the file and moves it into the created directory:</p>
<p>Some_Artist/Some_Album/Song_Name.mp3</p>
<p>This project uses CodeBox. You can read about CodeBox in the book itself, or
  in the readme for the source to this book.</p>
<p>This is an example of program that relies entirely on events and interfaces.
  None of the objects ever directly call one another. There is no shared data
  between the main objects in the program, other than the data needed by Frame1
  to create instances of the objects that will be in play. But Frame1 itself is
  not in play. All it does is instantiate other objects, it never does anything
  itself other than host the objects.<br>
</p>
<p>This model adds robustness to your program, and it makes each object discreet.
  However, there is a price you have to pay for handling things this way. In particular,
  if the user changes any data in the program, then all interested parties need
  to be notified via events. One object can't simply ask another object for its
  current state. Instead, if one object changes, then it tells the other objects
  that it has changed. Furthermore, only one object can &quot;own&quot; that data,
  and it must be the only object allowed to modify it.<br>
</p>
<p>For an instance of this, see the way that FileHandler sends an ActionEvent
  to both ControlPanel and DisplayData when the user selects a new directory.
  To make this work, you have to ensure that neither ControlPanel nor DisplayData
  have the ability to change this data. Only one object should be able to change
  the data, and it should tell other objects when that data has changed. If you
  don't obey these rules, then you have chaos.<br>
