<p> <strong>Description: </strong>This program is discussed in Chapter 23, Simple 
  Applications. The program outputs a string to the screen at the command line. 
  It is meant to be the simplest possible program you can write in Java. I show 
  this program not as a lesson in how Java works, but to show you how to get simple 
  programs of this type running in the IDE. Read Chapter 23 for a discussion of 
  that topic.</p>
<p>Here is the source:</p>
<pre>public class Java101<br>{<br>  public static void main(String[] args)<br>  {<br>    System.out.println(&quot;Turn, turn, to the wind and the rain.&quot;);<br>  }<br>}
</pre>
<p>You will be able to run this from the command line with <a href="../../index.html#ant">Ant</a>. 
</p>
<p>You could also first compile and then run it by issuing the following commands:</p>
<pre>javac Java101.java<br>java -cp . Java101</pre>
<p>The scripts run.bat and run.sh should allow you to run the program from the
  command line.<br>
